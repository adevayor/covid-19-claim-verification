      "Transmission of Influenza on International Flights, May 2009\n",
      "####\n",
      "Transmission of ILIs on board these aircraft clustered closely with a passenger who was symptomatic during the flight or may have been in contact with an infectious passenger for >15 minutes during the flight. This finding is similar to transmission of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 noted on a long-haul flight to New Zealand in 2009 (6). Recent studies on the transmission of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 in ferrets demonstrated preference for aerosol and droplet transmission of the virus (15,16). A similar study investigating the disease in a tour group in China indicated droplet transmission from coughing or talking with the index case-patient as being the main mode of transmission (17). The cabin in the A380-800 (flight 1) allows for a 10% wider seat in economy class than does the 747-400 (flight 2) (18), and modern ventilation systems in aircraft circulate air around bands of seat rows rather than the through length of the aircraft (19). However, neither of these measures are enough to prevent droplet transmission from either talking (≈1 meter) or spread of smaller aerosol droplets (7,8).\n",

      "####\n",
      "BACKGROUND: Between January 24, 2020 and February 15, 2020, an outbreak of COVID-19 occurred among 335 passengers on a flight from Singapore to Hangzhou in China. This study aimed to investigate the source of the outbreak and assess the risk of transmission of COVID-19 during the flight. METHOD: Using a standardized questionnaire, we collected information on the travelers’ demographic characteristics and illness before, during, and after the flight. We also collected data on factors potentially associated with COVID-19 transmission during the flight. RESULTS: A total of 16 COVID-19 patients were diagnosed among all passengers; the overall attack rate was 4.8%. The attack rate among passengers who had departed from Wuhan was significantly higher than that among those who had departed from other places. One passenger without an epidemiological history of exposure before boarding developed COVID-19. During the flight, he was seated near four infected passengers from Wuhan for approximately an hour and did not wear his facemask correctly during the flight. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 transmission may have occurred during the flight. However, the majority of the cases in the flight-associated outbreak could not be attributed to transmission on the flight but were associated with exposure to the virus in Wuhan or to infected members in a single tour group.\n",

However, the majority of the cases in the flight-associated outbreak could not be attributed to transmission on the flight but were associated with exposure to the virus in Wuhan or to infected members in a single tour group.\n",

However, the majority of 16 cases in the outbreak were not attributed to transmission on the flight. Exposure to the virus in Wuhan or by infected members within the same tour group account for most cases in the outbreak.

      "Previous studies suggest that the basic reproductive number of COVID-19 ranges between 1.5 and 6.5. COVID-19 seems to be more transmissible than SARS and MERS [15]. However, in the present flight outbreak of COVID-19, the relative low number of the secondary cases that occurred due to transmission during the flight may be attributed to the wearing of masks, which have been shown to be effective in blocking the transmission of respiratory diseases at mass gatherings [22]. The low rate of transmission during the flight may also be attributed to the design of and equipment in the aircraft. The air recirculation system, with the highly efficient particulate filter equipment and laminar nature of airflow, may have effectively prevented or restricted the transmission of the virus [7,9]. In addition, after landing, all passengers were sent to designated places for medical isolation and observation. The strict management of all passengers further contributed to avoiding a larger travel-associated outbreak of COVID-19.\n",

      "Objectives: No data were available about in-flight transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Here, we report an in-flight transmission cluster of COVID-19 and describe the clinical characteristics of these patients. Methods: After a flight, laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 was reported in 12 patients. Ten patients were admitted to the designated hospital. Data were collected from 25th January to 28th February 2020. Clinical information was retrospectively collected. Results: All patients are passengers without flight attendants. The median age was 33 years, and 70% were females. None was admitted to intensive care unit, and no patients succumbed through 28th February. The median incubation period was 3.0 days and from illness onset to hospital admission was 2 days. The most common symptom was fever. Two patients were asymptomatic and negative for chest CT scan throughout the disease course. On admission, initial RT-PCR were positive in 9 patients, however initial chest CT were positive in only half patients. The median lung total severity score of chest CT was 6. Notably, Crazy-Paving pattern, pleural effusion, and ground-glass nodules were also seen. Conclusion: It is potential for COVID-19 transmission by airplane, but the symptoms are mild. Passengers and attendants must be protected during the flight.\n",

Although infrequently reported and difficult to assess accurately, respiratory agents may be easily transmitted to passengers during air travel owing to limited ventilation, high occupant density and a long exposure time [9,10]. Multiple outbreaks of respiratory diseases, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), measles, tuberculosis, and influenza, associated with air travel have been reported [[11], [12], [13], [14]].

Index patients on all seven flights were highly infectious (symptomatic, sputum smear positive for acid-fast bacilli, and evidence of cavitary disease on chest radiograph). There was strong evidence of tuberculosis transmission on three flights [11], [12], [16]. Infection was transmitted from one flight attendant to two other crew members on one flight [16], whereas transmission from the index case to fellow passengers and flight crew was documented in another two flights [11], [12]. Risk of transmission was associated with proximity to the index cases (sitting in same section of plane) and a long duration of flight (>12 hours). There was no evidence of transmission on the other four flights despite highly infectious passengers on board, suggesting that although in-flight transmission is possible, the risk is still very low.\n",

Moreover, we were unable to get a detailed and accurate trajectory of each case before boarding. Therefore, we cannot rule out the possibility that inapparent transmission between Case 16 and the other cases occurred in the shops, toilets, or airport lounge before boarding. Secondly, we did not perform virus isolation and genome sequencing of the virus, which could have provided evidence of whether viral transmission occurred during the flight. Thirdly, we did not perform surface swabs or take air samples in the aircraft cabin, and so do not have direct evidence of transmission occurring during the flight.\n",

      "The copyright holder for this preprint this version posted March 30, 2020. We believe that a most likely time for transmission of COVID-19 in the ten passengers was during or immediately before the flight. The clustering of illness onset around 3 days in these patients is consistent with the expected incubation period of COVID-19. There was no recognized exposure history within 14 days before this fight, although it is still possible that the passengers were infected before the flight because the incubation period could be longer up to 24 days [4] . Transmission on an aircraft of SARS-CoV-2 might occur when COVID-19 patients fly, especially during the symptomatic phase of illness. Therefore, we believe that the most plausible index case resulting transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in the other nine passengers was patient 1, the 45-year-old man from Wuhan, who had onset of fever during this flight.

Therefore, for simulation purposes, we used quantified data from influenza transmission on aircraft. To do this we extracted data from a relevant systematic review and re-analyzed it (see Appendix One). This work indicated that an index case might typically generate an average of 6.0 secondary cases on a flight of at least three hours duration (assuming no mask use and assuming SARS-CoV-2 is similar to influenza in infectivity in such situations). We assumed that cabin crew had the same per person risk of being infected and the same transmission rate as any of the passengers (in the absence of any data on this from the systematic review).

      "There is of course the limitation here that although pandemic influenza is a respiratory virus like SARS-CoV-2, these two agents might still have different transmission dynamics in the aircraft cabin setting. Another issue is that the in-flight influenza outbreaks in the systematic review did suffer from incomplete contact tracing (mean of 73% traced, median of 86% traced), and so the true burden of secondary cases is probably somewhat higher for these outbreaks. But countering this is the possibility that there might have been publication bias involved, given that in this review there were only 4/19 studies with zero secondary cases. This might suggest that large in-flight outbreaks of influenza were more likely to be studied (and published on) than those with no or little secondary spread. This may somewhat over-estimate the in-flight transmission of influenza, but it may be more appropriate for the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 which seems to have a higher reproduction number than influenza.\n",

      "Coronavirus disease 2019 , caused by the Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has been spreading rapidly since early cases were detected in Wuhan, China at the end of December 2019. 1 On March 11, the WHO declared the COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic; 2 i.e. it is now deemed to be on a global scale, with significant autochthonous transmission in different countries. The implications that such a declaration can have are that tackling the COVID-19 pandemic might require international coordination and collaboration. 3 To date, COVID-19 cases have been observed in over 100 territories, in all inhabited continents. 4 Such a pervasive spread is partly a consequence of the innate transmissibility of the virus, which is expressed by the relatively high basic reproduction number point estimates ranging from 1.4 to as high as 6.5 (with uncertainty bounds providing an even wider range). 5, 6 However, an additional prominent reason for the especially wide and rapid spread of COVID-19 is likely to be the current high prevalence of international air travel, which has rapidly increased during the last decades. 7 Moreover, air travel might have an interaction with the clinical characteristics of COVID-19, increasing the potential of the virus to spread. Although various other infectious diseases have caused epidemics through air travel, [8] [9] [10] none, barring influenza, have had as wide a global spread as COVID-19. Likely factors affecting this significant scale of transmission are the respiratory nature of the disease and a high frequency of presymptomatic (and, probably, to a lesser extent asymptomatic) infectors. 11 Both factors, which apply to influenza as well, 14 are hypothesized to help the spread through air travel. 12, 13 Although the spread of COVID-19 through maritime transport has received substantial media coverage due to significant transmission on the Diamond Princess and other cruise ships, 14 most imported cases outside China have likely originated from air travel. 15 These have spurred the applications of various outbreak control measures regarding air travel, including air travel restrictions, and quarantining individuals returning via air travel from specific countries, or regardless of their departure locations. 16 Consequently, sharp decreases in flight volumes have been observed, 15 in contrast with previous projections of a continuous increase in global air travel. 17 However, such outbreak control measures are non-selective, and are hence costly, inconvenient and substantially hamper general international travel. As such, at least a partial return to high flight volumes is plausible in the future. 18 A less restrictive possibility to control the COVID-19 spread is to concentrate efforts of detection and isolation of cases to specific locations. Risk assessments of scenarios of COVID-19 spread to new locations, or retrospective analysis or importation to certain locations, have been previously performed. [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] These studies mainly focused on the introduction of COVID-19 into highly vulnerable locations, often with public health infrastructures that may not respond efficiently to contain an outbreak. On the other hand, locations can also be determined as dangerous by their likelihood to disseminate infected individuals and initiate novel or reoccurring COVID-19 outbreaks in other locations. Investing additional resources in individual screening at high risk source locations might therefore prove efficient in preventing spillover from countries which do not completely cancel international flights.
